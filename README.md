# Description
Making use of [data.gov.sg's weather API](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/realtime-weather-readings) to populate a line chart. Chart refreshes every minute using AJAX. However, API only updates full data every 5 or more minutes, hence updates come every 5+ minutes.

# Tools
* AJAX
* Chart.js
* Bootstrap (minimal usage)

# TODO
* Display all stations' readings provided in API
* Feature to toggle past 24 hour chart (currently only showing today's data from midnight)
